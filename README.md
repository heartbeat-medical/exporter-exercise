# Heartbeat engineering challenge

Thank you for taking part in this and we are excited to see your work!

This repository contains a slimmed down version of an _exporter_ and associated
constructs for mocking functionality. There are three
tasks to complete.

The following files are simple mocks and need not be edited for the purpose
of this exercise.

```
1. src/logger.ts
2. src/permissions.ts
3. src/uuid.ts
```

## Tasks

### Task 1

Complete this README with a description of how the exporter works. You may
also add diagrams/code snippets, whatever you think is required ‚≠êÔ∏è

#### Description
The Exporter acts as Job Queue Manager. In a nutshell, it creates jobs and 
tracks/manages their statuses in a cache (redis). It exposes 3 main functions

**- `StartExport`:** Simply put, this function,
- Collects the User and the Job [Readable] Stream
- Tries to authorize the user's action based a configured permission requirement
- Creates a default Job object (including an id and a default status)
- Writes the job object to a cache with the "unique" identifier
- Pipes the Job Readable Stream to a Writable Stream that handles the following, both of which updates the job in cache
    - Chunk additions: Appends chunk to `<job-id>-data`
    - Job Completion: Updates job status 

**- `GetExportStatus`:** This retrieves a provided job object by their id from
cache and returns the status, for when it exists/hasn't expired and throws an error for when it is not found.

**- `CancelExport (My Addition)`:** The function, cancels any specific pending job,
- Closes the Streams
- Updates the Status


**Tips**

1.  Read through the various files.
2.  Map out the high level system
    architecture and important functionality.
3.  (optional) Add comments to the `src/exporter.ts` file.

**What we are looking for**

1. Clear explanations of what individual elements are.
2. Some parts may be confusing, that's ok. We are looking for a
   thoughtful consideration of the different elements.
3. Your approach to documentation.

### Task 2a üõ†

**Please choose either 2a or 2b!**

We need new functionality adding. In addition to starting and fetching the
status of exports. **We would also like to cancel currently running exports**. Please implement
this functionality.

**Tips**

1. _We are looking for a minimum working example_, try focus on getting to something working.
   We can talk through your design and architecture decisions during the next interview.
2. The cancel existing import functionality should ideally **stop** an existing import. So no
   further bytes are piped from data source to the cache.
4. Bonus points for helpful test coverage on new code.

### Task 2b üß™

**Please choose either 2a or 2b!**

The engineer who implemented this functionality forgot to add tests. We would like to cover
this feature with tests. Please add suitable tests for the exporter.

**Tips**

1. We are looking for how you approach testing code - be prepared to answer questions on why
   certain tests have been added!
2. Test names should be descriptive and help us understand why you chose to write that test.

### Task 3 üìà

What would you improve? We know this feature isn't great. What would you change?

**Tips**

1. We are looking for ideas such as patterns, principles and performance.
2. You don't need to implement any improvements, but feel free to use code
   examples where you feel it would be helpful.
